            <p>I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior 
              knowledge in software development. However,
               within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the 
               crux of software development and also master
                the soft skills required for being a software developer.


              So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
               push in my career as a software developer.</p>

            <p>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push 
              I needed to get in the real world space.
               I had an immense learning that was really different
                from the self learning I started with. 
                The learning was fun and there were some internship job 
                opportunities that were presented to us.
                 I got my first gig immediately after the program.

              Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

                    solvers who can design creative solutions.

                The web and the applications built for it have
                 transformed the way we do business globally, 
                 and is disrupting industries from education to 
                 manufacturing.</p>

                   You’ll have gained foundational skill in many
                    disciplines that touch web development – managing
                     complex data sets, securing your applications with 
                     encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your 
                     applications to prepare them to scale.</p>
                     <h3>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
                     <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC)
                        with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity
                         of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through
                          installing the necessary free software.

                      At least, you’ll require basic secondary school
                       mathematics, but no previous programming language
                        experience is required.</p>
