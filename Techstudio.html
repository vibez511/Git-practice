            <p>I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior 
              knowledge in software development. However,
               within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the 
               crux of software development and also master
                the soft skills required for being a software developer.


              So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
               push in my career as a software developer.</p>

            <p>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push 
              I needed to get in the real world space.
               I had an immense learning that was really different
                from the self learning I started with. 
                The learning was fun and there were some internship job 
                opportunities that were presented to us.
                 I got my first gig immediately after the program.

              Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

                   Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in many
                    disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing
                     complex data sets, securing your applications with 
                     encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your 
                     applications to prepare them to scale.</p>
                     <h3>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
                     <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC)
                        with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity
                         of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through
                          installing the necessary free software.

                      At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school
                       mathematics, but no previous programming language
                        experience is required.</p>
